# Simple

App should have one straightforward path solving a specific problem.

User should complete the process in a few steps.

# Lovable

Provide the value from day one (launch).

# Complete

The app should be complete at launch. Not MVP, but as simple.

The customer should have a genuine desire to use the product as-is.

Version 1.0 of something simple > Version 0.1 of something complex.
